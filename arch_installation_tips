First of all connect to Internet with however method you prefer.

Create two partitions on the disk
* esp partition -- fat32 -- 1G -- mount_point: /mnt/boot/efi
* root partition -- ext4 -- (as much as you want) -- mount_point: /mnt

Next uncomment(or add if doesn't exist) these lines in /etc/pacman.conf
  * Color
  * VerbosePkgLists
  * ParallelDownloads = 5
  * ILoveCandy

Now, install the system
`pacstrap /mnt/ base base-devel linux linux-lts linux-firmware efibootmgr grub os-prober exfat-utils networkmanager`
  * base base-devel                => all GNU programs that make up the system
  * linux linux-lts linux-firmware => self explainatory
  * efibootmgr grub os-prober      => self explainatory
  * exfat-utils                    => utilities used to us exfat file-system(because I use it)
  * networkmanager                 => self explainatory

Add the fstab file
`genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab`

Entering into the half installed system
`arch-chroot /mnt`

Setting up time-zone
`ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Kolkata /etc/localtime`

Now, to set-up locale, uncomment the line with "en_IN" in the file /etc/locale.gen
then run command,
`locale-gen`
`LANG=en_IN.UTF-8`

Next, to install grub, first uncomment the "GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false"in the file /etc/default/grub(so that it automatically detects other OS's, if available)
then run commands
`grub-install --bootloader-id=Arch --efi-directory=/boot/efi/ --target=x86_64-efi`
`grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`

Finally, add a root password
`passwd`

Just one more, uncomment the lines "%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL" and "%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL" in the file /etc/sudoers, so that other users from wheel or sudo group can run commands as root

Now, you're good to go with a single-user system
